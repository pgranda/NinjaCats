### Note:
The source of knowledge for GBA dev - http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/
All of gba and sinlut (except gba_drawing) .h and .c files were provided by Jamie Stewart. Slightly modified here and there by me for the purposes of the game.
Files starting with BG .h and .c were generated using Map Ed v0.98.5, program which allows you to create your own map from tiles.
Main logic of Particle and Emitter scripts was provided by Jamie Stewart and modified by me.
Smoke, worm and ninjacatsprites .h and .c were generated using USENTI, a bitmap editor and exported by Cearn's GBA Image Transmogrifier (GRIT) v0.8.3
